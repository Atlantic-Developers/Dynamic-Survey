# Dynamic-Survey
This an attempt to enhance the surveying experience in the world. We will connect the strength of AI, to make every survey more meaningful and feedback oriented. \
The idea is that the answer of the previous questions and the motive of the survey should decide every next question of the survey. So, every user will get a different set of surveys. \
Sound interesting? hold on, there are some big challenges. 
- How can we come to a decision real quick? If the questions are different for every user then the surveyer needs to read all user answers, right? That will be pathetic and time-consuming.
  > We will use machine learning techniques to generalize the user responses and possibly make a text report of findings with a visual representation of key metrics.
- Isn't it more prone to error?
  > You are right. But that's the whole purpose of "developing" this project. We want to solve the problems/errors.
  
- Is it necessary?
  > People love caring! Our believe is that if we can give a customized response to the users, they will be more engaged and the survey will have a higher success rate. 

The project was initiated in March 2024 and is expected to end by December 2024 [^1]
